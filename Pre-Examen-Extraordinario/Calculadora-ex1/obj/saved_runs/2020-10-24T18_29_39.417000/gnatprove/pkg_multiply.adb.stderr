pkg_multiply.adb:17:23: medium: precondition might fail, cannot prove First_Operand >= Integer'First - Second_Operand (e.g. when First_Operand = -1 and Result = Integer'First) [possible explanation: loop at line 15 should mention Result in a loop invariant][#0]
pkg_multiply.adb:21:23: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when Result = Integer'First) [possible explanation: loop at line 15 should mention Result in a loop invariant][#1]
