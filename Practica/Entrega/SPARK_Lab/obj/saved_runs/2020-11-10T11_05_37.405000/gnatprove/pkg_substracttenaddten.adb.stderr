pkg_substracttenaddten.adb:13:35: medium: loop invariant might not be preserved by an arbitrary iteration, cannot prove Vec(i) = Vec'Loop_Entry(i) - 9 (e.g. when Vec = (1 => -9, 2 => -10, others => 0) and Vec'Last = 4 and Vec'Loop_Entry = (1 => 0, 2 => 0, others => 1) and i = 2)[#1]
pkg_substracttenaddten.ads:28:22: medium: postcondition might fail, cannot prove Vec(i) = Vec'Old(i) - 9 (e.g. when Vec = (1 => -8, 2 => -9, others => 1) and Vec'Old = (1 => 0, 2 => 0, others => 4) and i = 1)[#2]
